#HW 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This weeks HW assignment focused on creating a portfolio page from scratch using the skills that we have learned so far in this bootcamp. This portfolio can one day be used to showcase to potential employers.

My portfolio starts out by displaying my header with my name, a photo, and navigation buttons including about me, work, and contact information. When clicked, these buttons scroll down to the corresponding information

I tried, but after multiple attempts, I was unable to place titles for each image for the work section. I tried to place div tags to be the container surrounding the title and the image itself but it would always break the flexwrap of my page.

The image of the first work image is larger than the others, and shrinks as the page gets smaller horizontally. This was done through the use of media queries.

When The work images are clicked, the website then navigates to the corresponding deployed application.

When the page is resized, the text and images wrap around to the next line to be able to display all the data on the webpage. This was done using flexbox tools.

This was a challenging HW assignment and I learned a lot from it.
