# 16 Project 2: Professional Materials
This portfolio has been updated from the second submission during week 8 of the coding bootcamp. The work section has been updated to include Project 2 as well as updated homework assignments that have been completed during the coding bootcamp.

I correctly centered the about me section responsive as well as other small tweaks to clean up the page.

I have pinned Project 2 as well as updated homework assignemnts on my GitHub profile. I have also updated bio section, added email, link to deployed portfolio, and have added a profile photo.

I have updated my resume to show what new skills I have aquired from this coding bootcamp as well as added project 2 to the project section.  

I have updated my linkedIn profile by filling in the bio summary section as well as provided links to Github and deployed portfolio.
